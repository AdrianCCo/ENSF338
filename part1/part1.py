#1. Checks if the if input is 1 or 0, if so then it will return the value of n
#   If the value is neither of the above, it will call the function twice recursively where the input is n - 1 
#   and n - 2 where they are added together and returned. Once n reaches 1, the function will return a value until
#   it reaches the initial caller of the function.

#2. No, this is not a divide and conquer algorithm 


#3. The big O notation for the recursive fibonacci function is O(2n) -> O(n). This is because for each input of n, the 
#   function will call the function recursively twice more until the input reaches 0 or 1
